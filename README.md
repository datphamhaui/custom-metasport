# Project MetaSport : a Metaverse for Sports

- This is the result of our internship at Talan Tunisie.
- We are the "Tankers" team and we were tasked to integrate the work of other teams in the same unity project.
- MetaSport is a metaverse platform dedicated to sports. Users are able to connect with each other in a virtual world,
interact and play sport games.
- We won the public award for the best internship team. ![imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kK0wJ44.jpeg)
- We first started a benchmark of available metaverse platforms (Decentraland, Sandbox, AltspaceVR) from which we decided
on the features and infrastructure of our project.
- Then we spent the rest of the internship implementing them on Unity.
